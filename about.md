Hi there, I am a data scientist who is currently living in Ottawa, Canada.
Technically related, I am interest in computer vision, natural language processing, 
orchestra of neural network families integrated with other modules. In general, I am into seeing 
how AI will impact human's behavior and development in many aspects. Life related, I like
playing bass, adventure sports and watching various TV shows just for fun. 

I'd like to use this place to centralize my learning and thoughts. So here we go.
