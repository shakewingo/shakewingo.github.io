I have to combine knowledge from 
[build-blog-jekyll-github-pages](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages)
and [running a website locally](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages#text-editor-) 
to enable work both locally and onlineâ€¦

To add math equation to Jekyll blog:
refer [add-mathjax-to-jekyll-pages](http://sgeos.github.io/github/jekyll/2016/08/21/adding_mathjax_to_a_jekyll_github_pages_blog.html)

Here's the example after inserting MathJax:
$$ r = h = \sqrt{\frac {1} {2}} = \sqrt{\frac {N} {N+1}} \sqrt{\frac {N+1} {2N}} $$
