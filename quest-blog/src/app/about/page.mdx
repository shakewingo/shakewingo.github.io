    Hi there, I am a data scientist currently living in Ottawa, Canada. Technically, I am interested in computer vision,
    natural language processing, and the orchestra of neural network families working in tandem with other modules.
    Beyond the stack, I am drawn to how AI reshapes human behaviour and development across many domains.

    Away from the keyboard you will usually find me playing bass, chasing adventure sports, or unwinding with new TV
    series. This space pulls those threads together so I can centralize what I am learning, testing, and thinking about.
