MoneyInOne ("MoneyInOne", "we", "our", or "us") is a personal finance application that helps you track assets and
liabilities across multiple currencies. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use and protect
it, and the choices you have. MoneyInOne does not require you to create an account; data is associated to a device
identifier for synchronization.

## Information We Collect

### Financial Information You Provide

- Asset information (type, name, amount, currency, purchase details)
- Credit/liability information (type, amount, currency, due dates)
- Portfolio calculations and summaries derived from the above

### Technical Information

- Device identifier (used solely to keep your data separate and enable syncing)
- Basic diagnostic and usage information necessary to maintain and improve the app (e.g., app version, performance events)

### Information We Do Not Collect

- Name, email address, phone number, or other contact information (unless you contact us)
- Precise location or biometric data
- Contacts, photos, or other device content
- Advertising identifiers for tracking across apps and websites

We do not track you across other apps or websites and we do not profile users for advertising.

## How We Use Your Information

- Provide core app functionality (store, compute, and display your portfolio)
- Synchronize your data across your devices using your device identifier
- Maintain, secure, and improve the app (e.g., diagnose performance issues)
- Provide technical support when you contact us

### Legal Bases (EEA/UK)

Where applicable, we process data based on: (i) performance of a contract (providing the app), (ii) our legitimate
interests (app security, improvement), and (iii) your consent where required (e.g., notifications). You may withdraw
consent at any time via your device settings.

## Data Storage and Security

- Data is stored securely on our backend infrastructure
- Data in transit is protected using industry-standard encryption (HTTPS)
- Access to production systems is restricted and logged

No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we implement reasonable safeguards designed to protect your data.

## Sharing and Disclosures

We do not sell your personal information. We do not share your financial data with advertisers or data brokers.

We may share limited information with service providers under contract to operate and improve the app, including:

- Cloud hosting/infrastructure providers (secure data storage and delivery)
- Market data providers (real-time asset prices such as stocks and crypto)

These providers may only process data on our behalf and under confidentiality obligations.

We may disclose information if required by law, to protect our rights, investigate fraud or security issues, or in
connection with a reorganization or transfer of our business (where permitted by law).

## Your Rights and Choices

- **Access and Modify:** View and edit the financial information you entered in the app.
- **Delete In-App Items:** Delete individual items within the app at any time.
- **Delete All Data:** Request complete deletion of data associated with your device identifier by contacting us (see
  Contact Us). We will verify the device identifier and delete associated data.
- **Export:** Request a copy of your data by contacting us.

We will respond to requests within a reasonable timeframe and in accordance with applicable laws.

## Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as you use MoneyInOne. If you request deletion or stop using the app, data associated
with your device identifier will be deleted upon verified request. We may retain de-identified or aggregated data that
does not identify you for analytics and service improvement.

## Children's Privacy

MoneyInOne is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children
under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided information, please contact us and we will delete it.

## International Users

MoneyInOne is operated from China. Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your
own. By using the app, you consent to such transfers. We take steps to ensure your information receives an adequate level
of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.

### GDPR/EEA Rights

If you are in the EEA/UK, you may have rights to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or object to processing, and to data
portability. You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority.

## California Privacy (CCPA/CPRA)

We do not sell or share personal information as defined by the CCPA/CPRA. California residents may request access to or
deletion of their personal information by contacting us (see Contact Us). We will not discriminate against you for
exercising your rights.

## Cookies and Tracking

The MoneyInOne mobile app does not use cookies. Our public website may use standard web server logs or analytics to
maintain and improve the site; please refer to the website notices where applicable.

## App Store Privacy Nutrition Label (Summary)

- **Data Collected:** Financial information you provide; device identifier for synchronization
- **Data Linked to You:** No (data is associated to a device identifier, not personal identity)
- **Tracking:** We do not use your data to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the "Last Updated" date above and, for significant
changes, provide an in-app notice or other appropriate notice. Your continued use of MoneyInOne means you accept the
updated policy.
